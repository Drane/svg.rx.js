# SvgBind

Sandbox for making SVG elements dynamically bind to each other.

## Build and test

<pre>
$ bower install svg.draggable.js
$ bower install jquery
$ npm install rx-lite
</pre>

Then open `index.html` in browser.

TBD: 

- panning the big rectangle should move its corners (sure, they are in a group)
- dragging the corners should resize the big rectangle
