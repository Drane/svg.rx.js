# TODO

- Do something about `demo3`.

Currently, `.rx_draggable()` expects that the draggable object's convesion matrix (scaling, rotation and translation) won't change during the drag. Should we have it so -- what are real world examples? AKa201015

- Would someone with Microsoft devices (using `pointerdown` etc.) want to suggest PR's? See -> [Issue #2](https://github.com/akauppi/svg.rx.js/issues/2)

- Adding support for more (touch) events: swipes, rotation etc. IF these need SVG specific help. I would like to see this coming up via real world needs, not #justforthesakeofit. If needed, using something like the [deeptissue.js](http://deeptissuejs.com) project may be okay, but I'd rather keep the `svg.rx.js` code really, really slim.
